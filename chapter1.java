        Excercise 1.1: know the jargons.
            1. In computer jargon, what's the difference between a 'statement' and a 'comment'?
                >>> In computer jargon, 'statement' means the line of code that performs the simple action e.g. System.out.println(); which is the print statement. On the other hand 'comments' is used to describe the written statements, but have no effect to executioning the program.
            2. What does it mean to say that a program is 'portable'?
                >>> the "portable" program means that the written program could be executed regardless of the machine that it is running on. The portable program is usually featured in high-level computer language e.g. Java, Python, etc.
            3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?
                >>> 'compile' is the computer process that translates the entire code written in high-level language on to the bytecode which is executable by the machine.
            4. What is an 'executable'? Why is that word used as a noun?
                >>> the 'executable' is used to describe the compiled source code which could be run by the machine without further modification of the code. Please note that the 'executable' file of each source code is vary machine by machine.
