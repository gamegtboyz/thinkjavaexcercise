Excercise 1.1: computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common Elgligh meanings. For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they're different.
  1. In computer jargon, what's the difference between a 'statement' and a 'comment'?
    >>> In computer jargon, 'statement' means the line of code that performs the simple action e.g. System.out.println(); which is the print statement. On the other hand 'comments' is used to describe the written statements, but have no effect to executioning the program.
  2. What does it mean to say that a program is 'portable'?
  3. In common English, what dos the word compile mean?
  4. What is an 'executable'? Why is that word used as a noun?
